The purpose of this language is to streamline the procedure of making ROBLOX Guis.
Inspiration has been taking from HTML-CSS ways of designing web pages.

There are 2 types of files, .rgss and .rg. 
.rg files is where you specify the physical structure of the gui (can also include styles as well) [Similar to HTML files]
.rgss files allow you to store style code such that it can be used in multiple rg files. [Similar to CSS files]

RG Files
--------

RG Files are where you specify the hierachy (what you see in the explorer) of a gui. 
For example, let's say you wanted to have a simple text "Welcome to the game" label 
with a button that says continue.

Syntax of RG Files (in a kinda peg grammar)

Instance <- ClassName InstanceName? '{' (PropertyAssignemnt / Instance)* '}'
PropertyAssignemnt <- Property ':' Value
Property <- property an instance has
Value <- Color / Boolean / Number / String
Color <- HexColor / RgbColor
HexColor <- '#'[0-9A-F]{6}
RgbColor <- RGB([0-255], [0-255], [0-255])
ClassName <- Name of a ROBLOX Class 
InstanceName <- Name of the instance (.Name property)

RGSS Files
----------

Aren't they implemented.
